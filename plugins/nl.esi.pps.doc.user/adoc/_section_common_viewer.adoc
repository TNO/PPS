[[panning-and-zooming]]
=== Panning and Zooming

The chart viewers supports zooming and panning, as follows:

.Zooming, using the mouse
* To zoom in, click in the chart area and drag towards the right and downwards.
  A rectangle shows the selected area.
  Once the mouse is released, the chart is zoomed in, only showing the selected area.
** Hold the kbd:[Ctrl] key while clicking and dragging to zoom horizontally only.
** Hold the kbd:[Ctrl + Shift] keys while clicking and dragging to zoom vertically only.
* To zoom out, click in the chart area and drag to the left.
  Release the mouse to zoom all the way out, to show the entire chart.
** Hold the kbd:[Ctrl] key while clicking and dragging to zoom out horizontally only.
** Hold the kbd:[Ctrl + Shift] keys while clicking and dragging to zoom out vertically only.

.Zooming, using the mouse wheel
Scroll up to zoom in and scroll down to zoom out.
The location of the mouse will be used as focus area, meaning that the chart will be zoomed in or out around that point.

* Hold the kbd:[Ctrl] key while scrolling with mouse wheel to zoom horizontally.
* Hold the kbd:[Ctrl + Shift] keys while scrolling with mouse wheel to zoom vertically.

.Zooming, using the keyboard
First click somewhere in the chart to activate keyboard focus.
While holding the kbd:[Ctrl] key, the arrow keys can be used to zoom the chart in or out.
Both the normal arrow keys as well as the arrow keys on the numpad can be used.

* Use the kbd:[→] or kbd:[←] key to zoom in or out horizontally.
* Use the kbd:[↑] or kbd:[↓] key to zoom in or out vertically.

In addition to the arrow keys, also 'browser style' zooming is supported. +
While holding the kbd:[Ctrl] key:

* Use the kbd:[+] key to zoom in both horizontally as vertically.
* Use the kbd:[-] key to zoom out both horizontally as vertically.
* Use the kbd:[0] key to zoom all the way out, showing the entire chart.

.Panning, using the scroll bars
* Use the vertical scroll bar or mouse wheel to scroll vertically.
* Use the horizontal scroll bar to scroll horizontally.

.Panning, using the mouse
Hold the kbd:[Alt] key while clicking and dragging the chart in the direction to pan.

.Panning, using the keyboard
First click somewhere in the chart to activate keyboard focus.
The arrow keys can be used to pan the chart in the desired direction.
Both the normal arrow keys as well as the arrow keys on the numpad can be used.

Right click on the chart to show a menu with even more options.

Furthermore, the action bar for time based views show additional buttons to zoom.

[[chart-selection]]
=== Selection in Chart

It is possible to select some of the items in a chart by clicking on them.
If an item supports selection and is selected, it is shown with a thicker yellow border.
Once selected, the details of the item can be seen in the _Properties_ view.

TIP: By default, the _Properties_ view displays normal properties. 
To view expert properties click the image:{imgsdir}/icons/filter_ps.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] btn:[Show Advanced Properties] button to reveal them. 

A context menu is available to select the current chart selection in the _Outline_ view.
This might be helpful for views that support <<outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering>>.

[[time-measurement]]
=== Measure Time

It is possible to measure the time between for instance the start of one task, and the termination of another task in a chart.
While hovering over a task, a gray vertical support line is shown.
While hovering over the first half of the task, it is shown at the creation of the task.
While hovering over the second half of the task, it is shown at the termination of the task.
Hold down the kbd:[Alt] key while such a support line is shown, and left click it, to keep the support line fixed at that moment in time.
Then hover to move the support line to another end point of a task and again left click while holding the kbd:[Alt] key.
An annotation is then shown that visually and textually shows the time between the two support lines.
The measurement is also added to the model and as shown image:{imgsdir}/icons/Measurement.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] in the _Outline_ view and the dirty (*) state of the editor.
The user can choose to save image:{imgsdir}/icons/save_edit.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] the measurement or to undo the operation by using the menu:Edit[Undo] menu.

TIP: To change the text of the measurement annotation, please <<chart-selection, select>> the annotation and edit the _Name_ in the _Properties View_.

[[chart-export-png]]
=== Export chart to PNG file

It is possible to save a snapshot of a chart by clicking the btn:[Export As Image] image:{imgsdir}/icons/export-image.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] from the view menu (small triangle button image:{imgsdir}/icons/view_menu.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] at the right top of the view).
The action will open a save dialog which allows you to select the location and the name of the exported PNG file.

NOTE: The PNG is saved with the same resolution and size as currently displayed.

[[synchronized-timing]]
=== Synchronize Timing

The time range in open viewers can be synchronized, so that multiple aspects on a time range as shown in the different viewers, can be analyzed simultaneously.
When one editor is zoomed or scrolled, the other editors remain synchronized.
This is especially helpful when editors are positioned above or 'on top of' each other.
As in that case, the margins to the left and right of the time range will be synchronized as well, such that the time ranges have the same width in the viewers.
The data for corresponding points in time are then vertically aligned, making it easy to correlate the data from the different viewers.

CAUTION: Time range synchronization only works if the ranges of two viewers overlap.
If the current visible range of a viewer is outside the range of another editor, time range synchronization behavior is unpredictable. 

image::{imgsdir}/compare-tmscs.png[width=1212,height=819]

Only PPS viewers that have a time range (typically the x-axis) support time range and margin width (the width taken by the margin labels, margin ticks, etc) synchronization.
If a viewer supports time range and margin width synchronization, some buttons will be present in the toolbar of the viewer.

[[synchronized-timing-actions]]
[cols="^10,30,60",options="header"]
|===
|Icon |Action |Description

|image:{imgsdir}/icons/time-synchronization-button-time-sync.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]
|btn:[Synchronize Time Range]
|If pushed, the current time range of the editor/view is explicitly synchronized to all other supported editors/views that have time range synchronization enabled.

|image:{imgsdir}/icons/time-synchronization-button-time-sync-enabled.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]
|btn:[Enable Time Range Synchronization]
|If checked, the editor/view will participate in time range synchronization.
If not checked, changes to the time range of the editor/view will not be automatically synchronized to any other editors/views, and the editor/view will not be synchronized to time range changes of other editors/views.

|image:{imgsdir}/icons/time-synchronization-button-margin-sync.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]
|btn:[Synchronize Margin Width]
|If pushed, the current margin width of the editor/view is explicitly synchronized to all other supported editors/views that have margin width synchronization enabled.

|image:{imgsdir}/icons/time-synchronization-button-margin-sync-enabled.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]
|btn:[Enable Margin Width Synchronization]
|If checked, the editor/view will participate in margin width synchronization.
If not checked, changes to the margin width of the editor/view will not be automatically synchronized to any other editors/views, and the editor/view will not be synchronized to margin width changes of other editors/views.
|===

Currently, PPS viewers do not support manually changing the margin width.
As such, the margin width is only synchronized by explicit request, using the btn:[Synchronize Margin Width] toolbar button (image:{imgsdir}/icons/time-synchronization-button-margin-sync.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]).
To reset the margin width of an editor/view, click the btn:[Refresh] toolbar button (image:{imgsdir}/icons/time-synchronization-button-refresh.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]).

Disabling time range and margin width synchronization can be useful when dealing with large traces.
Zooming in to a specific part of a trace while having time range synchronization enabled may lead to performance issues.
To mitigate this, disable time range synchronization on a view, zoom in to the time range of interest within that view, re-enable time range synchronization for the view, and press the btn:[Synchronize Time Range] toolbar button (image:{imgsdir}/icons/time-synchronization-button-time-sync.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]) to explicitly synchronize the new time range to the other views.
That way, the other views are only updated once.

Time range and margin width synchronization are performed per workbench window.
If you open a second workbench window, the editors/views within each workbench window are synchronized.
Editors/views across different workbench windows are not synchronized.
This is helpful when looking at different traces in separate workbench windows.

[[outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering, dynamic inclusion filtering]]
=== Dynamic Inclusion Filtering

Typically PPS works with large data sets.
This complicates focussing on relevant data and the following functions therefore have been added to the _Outline_ view.

[cols="^30,30,60",options="header"]
|===
|Icon |Action |Description

|image:{imgsdir}/outline-filter.png[width=184,height=54,pdfwidth=1.53in,pdfheight=0.45in]
|btn:[type filter text]
|Dynamic filtering of its elements, by means of entering a search pattern in its filter text box.

+++The pattern may contain '*' for 0 and many characters and '?' for exactly one character. Literal '*' and '?' characters must be escaped in the pattern e.g., '\*' means literal '*', etc. Escaping any other character (including the escape character itself), just results in that character in the pattern. e.g., '\a' means 'a' and '\\' means '\'+++

|image:{imgsdir}/icons/push_context.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]
|btn:[Push Context]
|If checked and one or more elements are selected, the selected elements are set as input for the active editor.
The editor will threat this input as it context and show the most relevant information accordingly.

|image:{imgsdir}/icons/push_selection.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]
|btn:[Push Selection]
|If checked and one or more elements are selected, the selected elements are also highlighted in the active editor.

|image:{imgsdir}/icons/push_time.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in]
|btn:[Push Time Range]
|If checked and one or more elements are selected, the time range to show these elements is calculated and is set to the active editor.
