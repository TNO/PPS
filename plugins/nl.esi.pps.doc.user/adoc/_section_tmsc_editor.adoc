== TMSC graphical viewer

The runtime behavior and timing of software applications can be visualized using Timed Message Sequence Charts (TMSC).
Various generic analysis techniques like critical path, root-cause, outlier identification analysis can be applied to the TMSC model.
To learn more about Timed Message Sequence Charts, please read section <<tmsc>>.

The TMSC `\*.tmsc` or `*.tmscz` files can be viewed by using the TMSC graphical viewer.
By double clicking on a TMSC file, this viewer opens.
After opening the viewer, the viewer starts loading the model.
Once the model is loaded, the viewer is filled with the data from the model.
The editor features various views, each with a different purpose, namely:

* Project Explorer View (detached)
* Outline View (detached) 
* Selection View (tab)
* Timed Message Sequence Chart View (tab)
* PlantUML View (detached) 
* Data Analysis View (detached)

=== Timed Message Sequence Charts

The runtime behavior and timing of software applications can be visualized using Timed Message Sequence Charts (TMSC).
In a TMSC, executors are shown on as horizontal swimlanes, and (real) time is shown along the horizontal axis.
The labels of the executors are shown on the vertical axis.
An executor is  a single threaded computational resource with run-to-completion semantics.
The function calls that are executed by an executor are shown as bars within its swimlane and are called executions.
The bars are labeled with the function name.
Nested function call executions are drawn as stacked bars, resulting in a call stack.
Arrows between the bars denote the data and control flow dependencies.
The arrows indicate where executors are communicating with each other.
Section <<tmsc-relations-uml-sdl>> compares TMSCs to similar representations.

Section <<tmsc-tmsc-view>> shows an example visualization.

[[tmsc-relations-uml-sdl]]
==== Relations to (Message) Sequence Charts and Flame Graphs

To give some more intuition about Timed Message Sequence Charts, they are compared to similar representations.

Timed Message Sequence Charts are similar to UML Sequence Diagrams and SDL Message Sequence Charts.
The main differences are:

* The horizontal axis and vertical axis are swapped such that life-lines are positioned horizontally, and the vertical axis shows the life-line labels.
* The life-lines represent autonomous execution entries, similar as in SDL.
* Life-lines are shown as swim-lanes.
* Arrows represent asynchronous messages, i.e. the sending executor continues execution directly.
* Overlapping executions are drawn as stacked boxes, instead of overlapping boxes.
* Labels are shown inside the executions, instead of on the arrows.
* The horizontal axis shows the (real) time, such that the length of an execution represents the actual duration of that execution, and the distance between the start and the end of an arrow represent the latency of message passing. 
* Fragments, such as loops, alternatives and references, are not allowed in Timed Message Sequence Charts.

ifdef::output-html[]
These differences are illustrated with the animation below.

image::{imgsdir}/tmsc_animation.gif[width=450,height=400,pdfwidth=3.75in,pdfheight=3.33in]

These differences are illustrated with the picture below.

image::{imgsdir}/tmsc_static.png[width=724,height=695,pdfwidth=6.03in,pdfheight=5.79in]
endif::output-html[]

Timed Message Sequence Charts are also similar to Call Charts or Flame Charts.
It can be argued that Timed Message Sequence Charts have a Flame Chart for each executor.
These Flame Chart are connected by arrows to show inter-executor relations.
Note that, Flame Charts should not be confused with Flame Graphs, 
Flame Graphs put the alphabet on the horizontal axis instead of the time, http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html#Variations[see Brendan Gregg's pages^].

[[tmsc-critical-path-analysis]]
==== Critical Path Analysis

The TMSC also allows more advanced analysis like critical path analysis.
Critical path analysis is always applied on the full TMSC.

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction[transitive reduction^] is applied on the TMSC before the analysis is performed.
In short this means that all path segments which are superfluous are removed.

Critical path analysis to an event can be applied by following the TMSC dependencies in their opposite direction, only taking the route of dependencies with the shortest duration.

The description above is a very simplistic summary of a much more sophisticated algorithm as described in this paper: http://www.es.ele.tue.nl/esreports/esr-2019-01.pdf[Inferring Timed Message Sequence Charts from execution traces of large-scale component-based software systems^].
The algorithm as described in the paper is used as base for implementation.

[[tmsc-metric-analysis]]
==== Metric Analysis

The TMSC metric analysis allows to validate whether timing requirements are met for predefined metrics.
Currently, metrics and their budgets can be defined programmatically by means of implementing an extension point as described in the PPS developer guide.
When a metric is analyzed, this results in a sequence of metric instances, one for every occurrence found.
Each metric instance has a duration and all metric instances are analyzed to mark instances that exceed their budget.

[[tmsc-root-cause-analysis]]
==== Root cause analysis

CAUTION: The functionality as described in this section still needs to be formalized in a paper.
This section will be updated when the paper is available.

IMPORTANT: Please read section <<tmsc-activities-and-paths>> prior to this section.

Automatic root cause analysis can automatically detect if a metric instance was delayed by either resource contention and or service contention.
This section explains the detection algorithm on a high level.

[[tmsc-service-contention]]
.Service contention
Service contention basically means that an activity cannot execute as fast as possible because it is delayed by another activity which uses the same services.
To detect this, two ingredients are needed: the <<tmsc-critical-path-analysis, critical path>> and the <<tmsc-activities-and-paths, activity TMSC>>, both between the start and end of a metric instance.
We can now say that all critical TMSC dependencies which are not part of the activity TMSC are caused by _service contention_.

[[tmsc-resource-contention]]
.Resource contention
Resource contention basically means that an execution within an activty takes more time than normal, but what is 'normal'.
For metric instances multiple instances can be found within a trace.
Typically these metric instances execute the same software functions in the same sequence, what we call repetitive behavior.
We can use this repetitive behavior to determine the 'normal' execution time for each function within a metric instance.
Outlier detection based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range#Outliers[interquartile range^], with a multiplicand of 3.0, is used to detect _resource contention_.

The _Outline_ view supports dynamic filtering of its elements, by means of entering a <<outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering, search pattern>> in its filter text box.

image::{imgsdir}/outline-filter.png[width=140,height=47,pdfwidth=1.17in,pdfheight=0.39in]
====

The _Outline_ view shows the model in a tree view.
Clicking an element in the tree selects the element and shows the details of that element in the _Properties_ view.

By selecting elements in the tree both the resource and time context of an editor view can be reduced, see also Section <<outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering>>.
With reduction of the resource context is meant that the editor area will show only content which is related to the selected _Outline_ elements.
For example, when a life-line is selected, the <<tmsc-tmsc-view>> view will only show this life-line and the life-lines that it directly communicates with.
This feature is active if the image:{imgsdir}/icons/push_context.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] btn:[Push Context] toggle bottom is selected.

[[tmsc-selection-view]]
=== Selection view

The _Selection_ view tab is similar to the _Outline_ view.
It shows the model in a tree view.
Clicking an element in the tree selects the element and shows the details of that element in the _Properties_ view.

This view supports dynamic filtering based on the _Outline_ view selection (see section <<outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering>>) to filter elements of interest.

[[tmsc-tmsc-view, TMSC view]]
=== Timed message sequence chart view

In a TMSC, the life-line of an executor is shown on as a horizontal swimlane, and (real) time is shown along the horizontal axis.
The executor labels are shown on the vertical axis.
The function calls that are executed by an executor are shown as bars within the swimlane.
The bars are labeled with their execution name.
Nested function call executions are drawn as stacked bars, resulting in a call stack.
Arrows between the bars denote the data and/or control flow dependencies.
The arrows indicate where executors are communicating with each other.

Due to <<outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering>> some executors might not be shown; however, the visible executors might communicate with this hidden executors.
Communication text balloons are shown in this case, depending on the <<tmsc-dependencies-visibility, selected dependencies visibility>>.
The arrow from/to the balloon indicates the data flow of the communication and the text in the balloon describes the other side.

image::{imgsdir}/tmsc-tmsc-view.png[width=1515,height=1030]

It is possible to select executions or dependencies by clicking on them, also see section <<chart-selection>>.
Selected elements are shown with a thicker yellow border.
Once selected, the details of the execution can be seen in the _Properties_ view and in the <<tmsc-data-analysis-view>>.

TIP: By default, the _Properties_ view displays normal properties.
To view expert properties click the image:{imgsdir}/icons/filter_ps.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] btn:[Show Advanced Properties] button to reveal them.
 
The _Timed message sequence chart_ view tab supports some common functions to support analysis of its data, like:

* Dynamic filtering based on the _Outline_ view selection, see Section <<outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering>>.
* Select executions and dependencies by clicking on them, see section <<chart-selection>>.
  Once selected, details can be seen in the _Properties_ view and in the <<tmsc-data-analysis-view>>.
* Measuring the time between executions, see Section <<time-measurement>>.
* Synchronize the current visible time window with all other supported editors, see Section <<synchronized-timing>>.
* Place a link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cbookmrk.htm[bookmark] at a specific area within a file. 
* Saving a snapshot of the chart, see Section <<chart-export-png>>.
* Panning and zooming, see Section <<panning-and-zooming>>.

On top of these common functions, the _TMSC_ tab has the following additional action bar buttons.

[[tmsc-rendering-strategies]]
==== Rendering strategies

Rendering strategies allow to visualize TMSCs from different viewpoints to support tailored user feedback for different analyses.
When just viewing a TMSC, different colors and strokes for executions and dependencies might help the user to better understand their domain, whereas for, e.g., critical path analysis it is important that the dependencies on the critical path are highlighted.
The rendering strategies in PPS are flexible and extendible (as described in the developer guide).

TIP: Performing an analysis may change the applied rendering strategy.
Please use the <<tmsc-rendering-strategy-selection, rendering strategy toolbar button>> to go back to the previous rendering strategy if needed.

[[tmsc-data-analysis-view]]
=== Data Analysis view

TIP: To open the Data Analysis view, click the menu:Window[Show View, Data Analysis] menu.

This view can be used to perform analysis on TMSC elements like executions, messages or metrics.
By <<chart-selection, selecting>> an element, it can be analyzed in detail.
All comparable occurrences of the element will be collected and analyzed in the selected chart.
What makes an element comparable, depends on the type of the element.
For executions, their function and either component or executor are considered.

Apart from the standard analysis of a single element, there is also the possibility to analyze measurements.
To access this function, the user must first perform a <<time-measurement, time measurement>> for two executions.
By selecting the measurement, the execution pair can be analyzed in detail.
All occurrences of execution pairs for the selected measurement will be collected and analyzed in the selected chart.

The charts in the _Data Analysis_ view support some common functions to support analysis of their data, like:

* Panning and zooming, see Section <<panning-and-zooming>>.

    From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range#Outliers[Wikipedia^]: 
    The interquartile range is often used to find outliers in data.
    Outliers here are defined as observations that fall below stem:[Q1 − "multiplicitant"*IQR] or above stem:[Q3 + "multiplicitant"*IQR], where a multiplicitant of 1.5 is used to detect mild outliers and 3 is used for extreme outliers.

Sigma test::
    From http://www.brendangregg.com/Articles/Detecting_Outliers.pdf[Brendan Gregg^]: 
    This identifies the presence of outliers based on their distance from the bulk of the data, and should be relatively easy to understand. +
    First, calculate the max sigma: +
    stem:[maxσ = (max(x) – μ) / σ] +
    This is how far the max is above the mean, μ, in units of standard deviation, σ (sigma).
    The sigma test is then: +
    stem:[outliers = (maxσ >= "threshold")] +
    If any measurement exceeds "threshold" standard deviations, we can say that the sample contains outliers.

Range::
    Outliers here are defined as observations that fall below stem:["min"] or above stem:["max"]

[[tmsc-time-series-viewer]]
==== Time series viewer

This chart displays the durations for all comparable elements for the selected element, including the element itself.
A description for the selected element is displayed in the title of the chart.
Statistical information can be found just below the title of the chart: mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.

image::{imgsdir}/tmsc-data-analysis-time-series.png[width=653,height=288,pdfwidth=5.44in,pdfheight=2.40in]

Every occurrence will be visualized as a vertical bar, with the height being equal to the duration.
The occurrences are ordered 'as is', just like the order in the original data set.
The originally selected element is also selected in the bar chart.

IMPORTANT: If a <<tmsc-metric-analysis, metric>> is selected, the durations of its instances will be visualized, where red bars denote instances that exceed the metric budget.

On top of the common _Data Analysis_ functions, the _Time Series Chart_ view also supports <<chart-selection, selection>> and the following additional action bar buttons.

a|If pushed, the current selection of the Data Analysis view is synchronized to the <<tmsc-outline-view>> of the TMSC graphical viewer.

NOTE: Depending on the <<outline-dynamic-inclusion-filtering, content outline settings>> the selection may also be pushed to the active viewer.

[[tmsc-histogram-viewer]]
==== Histogram viewer

This chart displays a histogram of the durations for all comparable elements for the selected element, including the element itself.
A description for the selected element is displayed in the title of the chart.
Additional statistical information can be found just below the title of the chart: mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.

image::{imgsdir}/tmsc-data-analysis-histogram.png[width=653,height=288,pdfwidth=5.44in,pdfheight=2.40in]

The width of the duration intervals on the x-axis can be adjusted by the user using the 'Nr. of bins' slider.
The duration of the originally selected element is shown as a vertical, yellow marker.
The red line shows the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function[Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)^] which shows the probability that the duration will take a value less than or equal to asciimath:[x].
