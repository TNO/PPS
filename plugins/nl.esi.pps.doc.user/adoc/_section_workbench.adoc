== PPS Workbench

PPS is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on http://eclipse.org[Eclipse^].
For common information about the Eclipse Workbench, please read the link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-01.htm[Eclipse user guide].
The figure below shows <<fig-workbench>> with the most important editors and views for PPS.
The remainder of this section explain these views.

[[wb-project-explorer-view, Project Explorer]]
Project Explorer view::
 Within Eclipse, the files to work with are part of a project.
 The available projects are shown in the link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-27.htm[Project Explorer view].
 Each project is simply a directory on the hard disk, and can be expanded to show the files and directories it contains.
 By double clicking a file, it is opened in the <<wb-editor-area>> by the default editor that is associated with that file. +
 The files in the Project Explorer view support contextual actions by means of the <<wb-context-menu>>.
 The supported actions for a file are explained in more detail in the section of the editor that is associated with that file. +
+
TIP: Toggling the image:{imgsdir}/icons/synced.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] btn:[Link with Editor] button in the _Project Explorer_ view toolbar ties the view to always show the current file being edited.

[[wb-editor-area, editor area]]
Editor area::
 The editor area is marked as a red rectangle in <<fig-workbench>>.
 In the screenshot, the editor area contains two editors side-by-side.
 By default editors will be opened stacked, but editors can be moved by means of dragging the tab of an editor to another location. +
 The left editor shows the <<tmsct-editor>> and the right editor shows the <<tmsc-editor>>, that both are explained in more detail in their corresponding sections. +
+
TIP: Opening a textual editor and graphical viewer side-by-side is useful as the changes in the textual editor will be reflected in the graphical viewer upon save.
 
[[wb-bookmarks-view, Bookmarks view]]
Bookmarks view::
 Bookmarks are a simple way to navigate to resources that are used frequently.
 The link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-37-3b.htm[Bookmarks view] displays all bookmarks in the Workbench. 
 
[[wb-outline-view, Outline view]]
Outline view::
 The link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/coutline.htm[Outline view] displays an outline of a structured file that is currently open in the <<wb-editor-area>>, and lists structural elements. 
 The contents of the Outline view are editor specific and therefore explained in more detail in the section of its editor.
 
[[wb-properties-view, Properties view]]
Properties view::
 The link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cpropview.htm[Properties view] displays property names and values for a selected item such as a `Message` in <<fig-workbench>>.
 The contents of the Properties view are editor specific and therefore explained in more detail in the section of its editor. +
+
NOTE: By default the Properties view is stacked behind the link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/ctskview.htm[Tasks view].

[[wb-problems-view, Problems view]]
Problems view::
 As you work with resources in the workbench, various builders may automatically log problems, errors, or warnings in the link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cprbview.htm[Problems view]. 
 For example, when you save a <<tmsct-editor, textual TMSC>> file that contains syntax errors, those will be logged in the Problems view. 
 When you double-click the icon for a problem, error, or warning, the editor for the associated resource automatically opens to the relevant place. + 
+
NOTE: By default the Problems view is stacked behind the link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/ctskview.htm[Tasks view].

[[wb-plantuml-view, PlantUML view]]
PlantUML view::
 The plantuml library implements a DSL and renderer for many UML diagrams (class, sequence, objects, states, activities, ...). 
 See http://plantuml.com for more info about the DSL and renderer.
 The https://plantuml.com/eclipse[PlantUML view] integrates plantuml's functionality into Eclipse and displays contextual UML diagrams for a selected item such as an `Architecture` in <<fig-workbench>>.
 The contents of the PlantUML view are editor specific and therefore explained in more detail in the section of its editor.

[[wb-data-analysis-view, Data Analysis view]]
Data Analysis view::
 The Data Analysis view displays statistical information for a selected item such as a <<tmsc-time-series-viewer>> for a `metric instance` in <<fig-workbench>>.
 The contents of the Data Analysis view are editor specific and therefore explained in more detail in the section of its editor. +
+
NOTE: By default the Data Analysis view is stacked behind the <<wb-plantuml-view>>.

[[wb-context-menu, Context menu]]
Context menu::
 Many views in the PSS IDE support <<chart-selection, selection>> and with that, contextual actions based on the selection.
 The context menu can be visualized by right-clicking the mouse in any part of the view that has the selection.
 The context menu shows all available actions for both the view and its selection. +
+
