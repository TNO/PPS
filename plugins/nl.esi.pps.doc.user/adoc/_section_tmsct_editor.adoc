[[tmsct-editor]]
== TMSC textual editor

The TMSC textual syntax allows you to create small example traces, to explore, test or document PPS features.
The textual syntax is not developed for large traces as it will suffer from scalability issues.
For large traces a custom TMSC reconstructor should be implemented as documented in the PPS developer guide.

The TMSC textual editor provides syntax highlighting and code completion to support writing TMSCs.
It also provides means to customize the visualization of the TMSC by e.g., defining colors for executions and dependencies.
All features of the syntax are explained in the comment that are included in the `tutorial.tmsct` file that is part of the TMSC examples project as provided by PPS.
Use the menu:File[New > Example...] menu and choose the `TMSC Examples Wizard` to add this TMSC examples project to your PPS workspace.
Then click the btn:[Finish] button to complete the import.

[NOTE]
==== 
During import the following question may pop up.
You may want to check `Remember my descision`.
Then click the btn:[Yes] button to continue.

====

When the wizard is done, the `tutorial.tmsct` file is automatically opened in the editor area.
Upon a save of a `\*.tmsct` file, a `*.tmsc` file with the same name is automatically generated in the `src-gen` folder within the project.
This TMSC file can be opened with the <<tmsc-editor>>.

TIP: Toggling the image:{imgsdir}/icons/synced.png[width=16,height=16,pdfwidth=0.13in,pdfheight=0.13in] btn:[Link with Editor] button in the _Project Explorer_ view toolbar ties the view to always show the current file being edited.

In the screenshot below, the editor area contains the TMSC textual editor and the <<tmsc-editor>> side-by-side.
By default editors will be opened stacked, but editors can be moved by means of dragging the tab of an editor to another location.
Opening a textual editor and graphical viewer side-by-side is useful as the changes in the textual editor will be reflected in the graphical viewer upon save.
