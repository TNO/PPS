[[tmsc-reconstructor]]
== Creating a custom TMSC reconstructor

The TMSC textual syntax allows you to create small example traces, to explore the PPS features.
The textual syntax is not developed for large traces as it will suffer from scalability issues.
Besides that, it is assumed that when using PPS in another domain, traces in another format are already available.
In both cases it is advised to write your own _reconstructor_ that converts these trace directly into a <<tmsc, TMSM meta-model>> instance.
This section gives an example on how to create such a custom reconstructor.

The custom TMSC reconstructor example is included in the PPS distribution, in the `examples` directory.
The example can be easily imported into your development environment by using the menu:File[Import...] menu and then choose to import menu:General[Existing Projects into Workspace] from the tree.
Now continue the wizard and select all the projects from the `examples` directory to be imported. 

TIP: For more information on creating custom EMF resources or using extension points, please read the Eclipse and EMF documentation.

First choose a syntax for your trace (e.g., `tmsctrace` in our example) and register it by means of the `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.extension_parser` extension point in the <<plugin-xml-nl.esi.pps.tmsc.reconstruct, plugin-xml>> of your plugin.

The registered `nl.esi.pps.tmsc.reconstruct.TmscTraceResourceFactory` extends `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource.Factory` and creates an <<nl.esi.pps.tmsc.reconstruct.TmscTraceResource>> upon request.
In our example, this resource defines an interface `nl.esi.pps.tmsc.reconstruct.TmscTraceEvent` between the parser and the reconstructor to separate the concerns of parsing and model forming.
The call-outs after the example provide some more information.

<1> Extending `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.impl.ResourceImpl` allows you to implement the `doLoad(InputStrweam, Map)` method.
If you also need to be able to save a TMSC model instance to your trace format, please implement the `doSave(OutputStream, Map)` method.
<2> At the beginning of the load, the `TmscReconstructor` is initialized by calling its `preReconstruct()` method.
This will prepare the <<architecture>> and <<tmsc>>.
<3> For every line in the trace, a `TmscTraceEvent` is created by the `TmscTraceParser` and this event is fed to the `TmscReconstructor` by calling its `reconstruct(TmscTraceEvent)` method.
<4> The TMSC model instance is _well-formed_ by calling the `postReconstruct()` method on the `TmscReconstructor`.
    As part of the postReconstruct, some generic `nl.esi.pps.tmsc.util.TmscRefinements` are called, please see the `TmscReconstructor` implementation.
    Finally, the reconstructed TMSC and architecture are added to the resource contents.
