This developer guide describes how to tailor and extend the Platform Performance Suite (PPS) for a specific domain.

CAUTION: Reading this developer guide requires intermediate to advanced knowledge about programming for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
A good book to read as reference is https://www.google.com/search?q=ISBN+13%3A+9780321331885[EMF: Eclipse Modeling Framework].

== Start developing for PPS

So, you got a binary distribution of PPS and you want to tailor it for your own domain specific use?
This section describes how to convert your PPS to an Eclipse PDE to customize PPS.

. First extract the PPS distribution, choose a PPS version (i.e., windows or linux), extract it and start it, e.g. `pps.exe`.
. Now use the menu:Help[Install New Software...] menu to install the `Eclipse Plugin Development Tools` from the Eclipse 2021-12 (i.e., 4.22) update site: https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.22/[] +
+

. Continue the wizard using the btn:[Next] button and finally the btn:[Finish] button. 
  When asked, choose to restart the Eclipse IDE.
. (The next steps are optional, yet advised) Install the PPS sources by again using the menu:Help[Install New Software...] menu.
  Now choose to add an update site by clicking the btn:[Add..] button. 
. In the `Add Repository` dialog, choose to add an archived update site by clicking the btn:[Archive...] button.
  Navigate to the directory where the PPS distribution is extracted and select the `nl.esi.pps.product-__<version>__.zip` archive.
  Finally click the btn:[Add] button in the dialog to add the repository.
. Now select the `PPS` category in the wizard and continue the wizard using the btn:[Next] button and finally the btn:[Finish] button.
  When asked, choose to restart the Eclipse IDE.
  
Your environment is now ready for extending PPS, e.g., <<tmsc-reconstructor, adding a custom TMSC reconstructor>> or <<data-analysis, extending its data analysis>>.

TIP: To start a PPS including your extensions, simply select one of your projects in the project/package explorer view and use its context menu (i.e., right mouse click) to menu:Run As[Eclipse Application].
A new Eclipse instance will be executed containing all PPS features including your own features.
